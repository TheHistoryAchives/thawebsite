# thehistoryarchive
An Archive dedicated to preserving History

We want to make it easy for everyone to contribute to preserving history. In the past, the winner wrote the history books, we are changing that. The History Archives is on a mission to help future generations learn about the past, our present.

Feel free to submit videos and photos and text of current events that are happening around the world. Please include the most details you possibly can, such as time of event down to the minute or even second, as many photos, videos, and/or text, other sources confirming or where you got the information, and what is happening in the photos or videos.

When it comes to the website, I am not the best at programming, but I am trying my best, feel free to make PRs to make the website or any other projects better in anyway possible.
